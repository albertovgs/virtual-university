# Virtual University

## Description
Virtual University is a comprehensive educational management system built on the CodeIgniter framework. It empowers educational institutions to streamline administrative tasks, enhance communication, and create an engaging online environment for both students and teachers. Join us in revolutionizing education management!

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- **LAMP Stack**: You'll need a Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP environment.
- **Proficiency in CodeIgniter 3.1, PHP, jQuery, and JavaScript**: Familiarity with these technologies is essential for customizing and extending the project.
- **Requirements for technologies are the necessaries for CodeIgniter 3.1** [here](https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/general/requirements.html).

## Installation
Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up Virtual University:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Prepare a LAMP environment, using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or a similar Linux distribution.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

   - **PHP version 5.6 or newer**: Ensure you have PHP installed on your system with a version of 5.6 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal.

   - **MySQL (5.1+)**: Virtual University relies on MySQL as its database management system. Make sure you have MySQL installed with a version of 5.1 or newer. You can verify your MySQL installation by running `mysql --version`.

   - **Apache Web Server**: Ensure you have the Apache web server installed. You can typically install Apache on Ubuntu using `sudo apt install apache2`.

2. **Project Configuration**:
   - Move the "Learning" folder to your Apache's HTML directory (typically `/var/www/html` on Ubuntu).

3. **Apache Configuration**:
   - Configure Apache to allow URL rewriting by editing the `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file.
   ```html Change
      <Directory /var/www/>
         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
         AllowOverride None
         Require all granted
      </Directory>
   ```
   ```html To
      <Directory /var/www/>
         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
         AllowOverride All
         Require all granted
      </Directory>
   ```

4. **Enable URL Rewriting**:
   - Run the following command to enable URL rewriting: `sudo a2enmod rewrite`.
   - Restart the Apache server: `sudo systemctl restart apache2`.

5. **Database Setup**:
   - In the `scripts` folder, you'll find a `.sql` file. Use this file to create the required database.

6. **Database Configuration**:
   - Open the `/var/www/html/Learning/application/config/database.php` file and provide the necessary database credentials.

## Docker Setup (Recommended)

For the fastest and most reliable setup, use Docker:

### Quick Start with Docker
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd virtual-university

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# Access the application
open http://localhost:8080
```

**Default Login Credentials:**
- **Email:** `admin@learning.edu`
- **Password:** `Hacker`
- **User ID:** `10000001`

### Docker Benefits
- **Zero Configuration**: No need to install LAMP stack manually
- **Consistent Environment**: Works the same across all operating systems
- **Isolated Dependencies**: No conflicts with your system packages
- **Easy Updates**: Simple `docker-compose pull` to get latest versions
- **Built-in Health Checks**: Automatic monitoring and recovery

### Docker Requirements
- Docker (version 20.10+)
- Docker Compose (version 2.0+)
- 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended
- 5GB free disk space

For detailed Docker setup, configuration, troubleshooting, and production deployment, see the comprehensive [Docker Setup Guide](README-Docker.md).

### Docker vs Manual Installation

| Feature | Docker Setup | Manual Installation |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Setup Time** | 5 minutes | 30+ minutes |
| **Dependencies** | Docker only | LAMP stack required |
| **Cross-platform** | ‚úÖ Works everywhere | ‚ùå Linux/macOS mainly |
| **Isolation** | ‚úÖ Containerized | ‚ùå System-wide |
| **Updates** | ‚úÖ Simple commands | ‚ùå Manual process |
| **Troubleshooting** | ‚úÖ Standardized | ‚ùå System-dependent |
| **Production Ready** | ‚úÖ Built-in features | ‚ùå Manual configuration |

**Recommendation**: Use Docker unless you have specific requirements for manual installation.

## Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer a traditional LAMP setup instead of Docker, follow the installation steps above starting from "Environment Setup".

## Usage

### Docker Usage (Recommended)
If you used Docker setup:
1. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. Use the default credentials: `admin@learning.edu` / `Hacker`
3. Access health checks at http://localhost:8080/health

### Manual Installation Usage
If you used manual LAMP setup:
1. Open your web browser and navigate to your localhost using the name "Learning" (or the name you assigned to the project folder)
2. Use the default user account provided in the `.sql` file to log in to the web system

### Common Operations
- **Start services**: `docker-compose up -d` (Docker) or start Apache/MySQL manually
- **Stop services**: `docker-compose down` (Docker) or stop services manually  
- **View logs**: `docker-compose logs web` (Docker) or check Apache error logs
- **Database access**: Use provided credentials to connect via MySQL client
